## **Overview**  
The Social Media Article Analysis Dashboard is designed to analyze and visualize trends from social media posts, including engagement metrics, sentiment distribution, and key topics. It helps users explore how a particular topic or URL is discussed online.  

This dashboard is implemented using **Streamlit**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **NLTK** for sentiment analysis. It processes and visualizes data extracted from social media platforms such as Reddit, Twitter, or news forums.

## **System Design Thought Process**  
The system is structured into three main components:  

### **a. Data Loading and Preprocessing**  
- **Purpose**: Ensure the dataset is structured properly before analysis.  
- **Key Steps**:  
  - Load data from a CSV file.  
  - Validate the presence of expected columns.  
  - Convert the date column to a proper `datetime` format.  
  - Compute sentiment scores using `VADER` sentiment analysis.  
  - Assign sentiment labels (`Positive`, `Neutral`, `Negative`).  

- **Why?** Ensuring data consistency is crucial for accurate visualization.

### **b. Interactive Filtering and Dashboard Structure**  
The dashboard consists of multiple sections that allow users to explore the data dynamically.  

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Sidebar for Filters**  
- **Why?** Users can adjust filters to focus on a specific date range.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - A date range selector is used to filter data dynamically.  

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Article Summary**  
- **Why?** Gives users a quick understanding of the most relevant article.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Displays the **title, source, and top hashtags** from the first matching result.  

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Engagement Metrics Over Time**  
- **Why?** Helps track how a topic is trending over time.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - A **time-series line graph** using `Matplotlib` to show **likes** and **comments** over time.  
  - **Labeling Change**: Instead of `score` and `num_comments`, we label them as **"Likes"** and **"Comments"** for clarity.  

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Sentiment Analysis**  
- **Why?** Shows how people feel about the topic.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - A **pie chart** that visualizes the proportion of positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.  

#### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Word Cloud (Popular Terms)**  
- **Why?** Helps users understand the common words used in discussions.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - A **WordCloud** is generated using the `wordcloud` library from the collected text data.  

#### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Top Comments**  
- **Why?** Shows the most upvoted and relevant comments.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - The top 5 comments with the highest likes are displayed.  

#### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Summary Statistics**  
- **Why?** Gives an overall engagement summary.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Displays **total likes, total comments, and average upvote ratio**.
